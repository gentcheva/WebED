General design  - menu with all the modules
	each module will have the same menu, but also a menu specific to that module page
	for navigating around the Module material

We need a design for the 2 menus 
	- they have to be distinct and implemented with CSS and JS/frameworks ( for practice )

Graphical design :
	we need a look and feel for the whole website
		-consistant design -  theme, colors, fonts 
		-positioning of pictures and material.
	layout of the page.
	implementing Usability engineering techniques- etc. paragraph lengths 
	Good optimization  - size of images is important
	responsive design - for mobiles.
	

possible things to consider:
	automatic code higlighting for Java
	animations for menus
	animations for interactive content showing (Jquery / JS ) 
		- for example show/hide answers or images for questions
	
	making a maintainable design to update this page next semester with new modules.
	
	additional page to implement coursework material like DBs with php
	make a simple game for when you are bored from studying
		- like xes and oes

	Consier using Sass or an other CSS variant

index.html  - introductory welcome page, will contain previews of all the module pages.

module pages - each will have a delicate color theme, with its own menu, in addition to the main menu. 

additional pages - simple javascript canvas games
		- showcasing a database connection using php
