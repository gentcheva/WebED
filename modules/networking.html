        <h3>Overview - Lecture 1</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Section 1: networking basics</li>
                    <li>Section 2: application layer</li>
                    <li>Section 3: transport layer</li>

        <h3>What is the internet? - Lecture 2</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Millions of connected devices</li>
                <li>Communication links - optic fibers, copper radio</li>
                <li>Protocols - TCP/IP, HTTP and Skype</li>
                <li>Network of networks: loose hierarchy - public internet vs intranet</li>
                <li>Internet Standards - standardized by IETF</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Internet as a service</h3>
        <p>Communication infrastructure which enables:
            <ul>
                <li>Emails, games, e-commerce, file sharing</li>
                Communcation services provided to apps: reliability, security, speed, streaming - continuity
                <li>reliable data delivery</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>What is a protocol?</h3>
        <p>Rules governing the exchange or transmission of data. Creates no ambiguity in communications.</p>
        <h3>Network structure</h3>
        <p><i>Network edge</i> contains useful devices, with processors and memory, whereas the core of the netwrok contains
            dumb machines, due to their proximity to the <i>central office</i></p>

    <section id="l2" class="lectures">
        <h3>How to connect end systems to edge router?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Residential access nets</li>
                <li>Institutional access networks, ie uni</li>
                <li>Mobile access networks - must keep in mind the bandwidth - amount of data per unit of time</li>
                <li>measured in bits, not bytes</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Connecting to the internet</h3>
        <p>Internet connection is done via the telephone network, its the most logical thing to do, seeing as the telephone network 
        is already set up. Voice is converted to digital, on different frequencies to the data, so there is no interferance.
        Data rate and width frequencies are proportionate - <i>this</i>i> is the <i>bandwidth</i>
        Signal fades/decays over distance - the closer you are to the central office, the better the connection.

        <h3>Network Core</h3>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>mesh of interconnected routers</li>
            <li>The fundamental question: How is data transferred through thr network:</li>
            <li>Circuit switching: used in telephone network</li>
            <li>Packet switching: used for internet</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Circuit switching - Lecture 3</h3>
        <p>
            A call/session, no dedicated resources.Finds path in the network, reserves <i>capacity</i> at <i>each</i> link
            as it passes through, for good call quality. Must have a <i>call set up</i> ie this computer  and that computer
            want to 'talk'.
            How to divide the capacity?
	        Must divide into pieces, if its not used, it is an idle piece -  frequency and time division.
	        May divide frequency based on users, or on time - FDM and TDM.
            Every slot needs 64kbits so the conversation seems to be <i>continuous.</i>
        </p>
        <h3>Packet switching - reliable network.</h3>
        <p>
            You don't tell the network that 2 machines wish to communicate, the network does not know what you want to do.
           <ul>
            <li>No pieces - resources used as needed.</li>
            <li>Congestion - When the amount of data sent into network may exceed the network capacity</li>
            <li>Statistical multiplexing - Share link among packet statistically, based on demand</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Packet vs circuit switching</h3>
        <p>
        Packet switching allows more users to use the network.Circuit switching limits the number of users.
        For data that comes in bursts, when you're not sure how much data there is, and how many users there are and you donâ€™t know their demand, 
        packet switching is ideal.Congestion occurs in packet switching - not a reliable network.

        <h3>Network of networks - Lecture 4</h3>
        <p>	Roughly hierarchical 
            <ul>
                <li>Tier 1 ISPs is at the center</li>
                <li>Tier 1 providers interconnect, peer, privately</li> 
                <li>SLA - service level agreement</li>
                <li>2 ISPs: smaller companies - offer internet services on a regional basis.</li>
            Connect to one or more tier 1 ISPs, possibly other tier 2 ISPs
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Network performance</h3>
        How do loss and delay/latency occur?
        <p>Packets queue in router buffers.
        Packets are ready to send, they just must be pushed onto the link.</p>
        <h3>4 Sources if packets delay</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Nodal processing - checking bit errors, determine output link </li>
            <li>Queuing - time waiting at output link for transmission </li>
            <li>Transmission delay - time to send bits onto link = L/R , L = packet length, R = bandwidth </li>
            <li>Propagation delay  - delay = d/s, d = length of physical length, s = propagation speed medium</li>
            <li>s and R are <i>very</i> different quantities</li>

        </ul>
