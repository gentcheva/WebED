            <h2>Human Computer Interaction</h2>
            <p>In the past,usability was <b>not</b> a concern, people interacted with the machines
                in their own language, in binary. People did not think that computers could be used for anything else
                a apart from work or calculations.
                <li>Due to this <i>"language barrier"</i> not everyone could use computers
                    due to their difference/lack of education in this area.</li>
                <li> Human computer interaction,HCI, is constantly changing <b>and</b> evolving, making computers
                    accessible to <i>everyone</i>,
                    regardless of their background or status.</li>
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="l2" class="lectures">
            <h2>Changes in HCI</h2>
            <p>Over the years, software become more <i>complex</i>, it became <b>context-aware.</b>
                <li>Its like a <i>gps system</i>, it is aware of where you are and when you're on the move.</li>
                <li>Some software has been adapted for visually impaired/blind people - <b>screenreaders.</b></li>
                However, these screenreaders are <b>not</b> the best solution ever, they have a <b>high</b> execution
                time
                and are very prone to making <b>errors.</b>
                <li>As well as that, users' attitudes after using this software was <b>not</b> a
                    positive one. This has been a challenge for many years.</li>

            <h2>Interfaces</h2>
            <h3>The question is, what <i>makes</i> a good interface?</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A <i>good</i> interface must be easy to use, learn and remember, low execution time and user
                        friendly</li>
                    <li>But how do you identify if the interface is user friendly?</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>There are many factors associated with users, however, the main ones are:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Age</li>
                    <li>Education</li>
                    <li>Computer Literacy</li>
                </ul>
                Some applications need a considerable amount of specific knowledge - this creates <i>'gulfs'</i>
                It must also aim to <i>decrease/eliminate </i>gulfs,which are <i>gaps</i> between the developers
                <i>and</i>
                the
                end-users.

            <h2>Human Memory</h2>
            <p>Humans receive data in different forms, via senses such as <i>sight, sound</i> and <i>touch.</i>
                <ul>
                    <li>Humans store this data in <b>two</b> types of memory - short-term and long-term memory.</li>
                    <li>In <i>STM,</i> data is stored in very short periods of time, however, these periods of time may
                        be increased in the absense of other stimuli/distractions.</li>
                </ul>
                Info passes from the STM into the LTM, due to repitition and the meaning of the info.
                If the short term memory is i any way damaged, then the data will be stored for an even sorter amount
                of time,and no new long term memories would be created. Basically, you could'nt learn any new info or
                skills.

            <h2>More Human Memory - Lecture 5</h2>
            <p>As we know from before, repitition and meaing help to create long term memories. Adding a second medium
                to when you are
                learning smething to reinforce the memory. A way you could achieve this is via mouthing the words. This
                provides you with a second type of memory
                to recall, increaing you rchances of retaining the info you just learned.
            </p>
            <p><b>Recall</b> - retrieval of info as a result of conscince search</p>
            <p><b>Recognition:</b> automatic recover of info as a result of an external stimulus.</p>
            <h2>Recall</h2>
            <p>Episodic memory: our memory of events or experiences. <li>Allows to access items in serial info.</li>
                <b>Semantic:</b> relationship between info<li>Allows you to access info in the order in which it was
                    acquired</li>
                <li>Powerful but slow way of accessing info, complex network</li>
                <ul>
                    <li> â—‹ Items are arranged in classes, and may inherit attributes from parent classes</li>
                    <li>Greater number of levels in hierarchy, longer the recall time, the greater the mental effort is
                        exerted/needed</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Forgetting theory:</h3>
            <p>Decay is the main cause of forgetting,, specifically natural decay, which happens exponentially, quickly
                at first, but then slows down. Another reason why we may forget is because of new info. This new info
                may replace/corrupt existing info. For example, getting a new number will likely make you
                forget your old one - known as <b>retroactive interference</b>. When you can only remember your old
                number but not your new one, this is known as <b>practive interference.</b> Phsychologists belive we
                never tryuely forget anything, we just lose the access to certain parts of stored info.
                Memory is used in interactions with technology, recognition is mainly used, which is supported by
                meaningful icons, andappropriate consistent screen layout.Main concernns in relation to STM: minimising
                the load presented at any one time and also minimising the period for which items must be remembered.
                some techniques which help include:
                Showing which links were visited before
                Avoid modes via visual reminders - cursor
                If response is too slow - users forget what they're waiting for:
                <ul>
                    <li>Summaries of requested data</li>
                    <li>Maps/overviews of searchpayhs</li>
                    <li>Visual reminders of status - breadcrumb trails, like in flight booking, saying what step you are
                        on.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Visual perception - Lecture 6</h2>
            <p>
                human visual system can be divided into 2 stages:
                <li>physical reception of light</li>
                <li>processing and interpreting</li>
                There are both strengths and weaknesses to these 2 stages:
                <ul>
                    <li>Certain things cannot be seen even when present</li>
                    <li>Processing allows images to be constructed from incomplete information</li>
                </ul>
                Brain fills in the blind spot within the eye. We scan scenes, moving eyes rapidly, focusing on different
                parts, because we can only focus on small areas. We have spatial memory - remember where we were
                looking, on a page or a screen.
                Remembering the location of some piece of info does not require much STM.Luminance depends on: <li>
                    amounto flight falling on the surface.</li>

            <p>Adjusting focus due to objects in the distance - known as convergence. Micro-movements of the head are
                made, to help judge distance. Distance = reduction in clarity.
                <b>Post-attentive</b> - when we have to move our eyes and focus.

                Reading on screens - <b>25% slower</b> than printed text. Adult usually reads about <b>250</b> words
                <b>per minute</b> from a printed page.
