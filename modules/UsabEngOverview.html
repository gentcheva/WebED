                <p>Approaches that focus on UX/Usability are often called <b>user-centered design</b></p>

                <h2>Waterfall model</h2>
                <p>Requirements &#8594; design &#8594; implementation &#8594; verification &#8594; maintenance <br>
                    <b> Not very flexible</b>, can be made flexible by adding evaluation stage to each step, however it
                    then
                    becomes <b>very expensive and time consuming</b>
                </p>
                <p><b>Speed and flexibility</b> became more important <br>
                    Waterfall approach was <b>replaced</b> with <b>agile development </b>
                </p>
                <h2>Agile development - circular design</h2>
                <p>Products are developed and <b>redeveloped</b> in 2-4 week cycles -<b> sprints</b> <br><br>
                    this approach leaves little time usability testing, companies neglect usability </p>
                <p>Lean UX is<b> think - make - check</b> cycle <br>
                    fixes issues with agile dev. but often leads to waste and repetition</p>

                <h2>Dual Track - most modern approach</h2>
                <p><b>Discover and deliver</b> <br><br>
                    (4+ weeks) discover the <b>users, Requirements, prototypes, general research</b>.<br>
                    (2 weeks) deliver the<b> product</b>
                </p>

                <h2>General outline of methods</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Gather requirements</li>
                    <li>Develop a conceptual design, with Guideline and perceptual factors</li>
                    <li>Evaluate and revise, with metrics, cognitive modelling, studies </li>

                </ol>

                <h2>Requirements gathering</h2>
                <p>Area of expertise, who are the user, what is the app meant to do and how and where will it be used
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>What is the area of expertise?
                        <p> knowledge about the domain, e.g graphics app, you need to know about colors, layers,
                            transparency <br>
                            <b>domain analysis </b>- identifying domain knowledge <br>
                            <b> domain knowledge</b> - knowledge of the area of expertise, what the app specialises
                            in,
                            experts in a domain often think its <b>general knowledge </b><br>
                            Domain analysis involves talking to <b>experts and end users</b> ^ ^ </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Who are the users?
                        <p> draw up a <b>profile</b> with factors : education, computing skills, culture, attitude,
                            Age, Physical abilities/disabilities <br>
                            its hard to design for everyone, apps often fail <br>
                            Segment / segmentation - splitting users into small groups according to some criteria
                            <br>
                            <img src="../images/Usability/user-centered-design.JPG"></p>
                        <h2> Personas </h2>
                        <p> each of the groups can be represented with a <b>persona</b> ( a <b>specific profile</b> ).
                            <br>
                            a persona covers: all the factors above (pic) but also things like
                            likes/hobbies/dislikes/habits <br>
                            it combines characteristics from a bunch of <b>real people</b>, but should be
                            <b>consistent</b>
                            and realistic <br>
                            example: young person who uses <b>IT all the time </b>| a middle-aged person who uses IT
                            for<b> work </b>| someone who only uses IT for web-surfing ...</p>
                        <p><b>Primary users-</b> use the system/interface directly <br>
                            <b> secondary users -</b> specify a task that is performed by a Primary user
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>What do the users want to do?
                        <p>Important distinction: needs of professionals(<b>normative needs</b>) and needs of end
                            users(expressed needs<b> (SAY)</b> and felt needs<b>(ACTUALLY WANT))</b> <br>
                            many cases users lack the <b>vocabulary</b> to express their needs but feel them. <br>
                            methods for identifying user needs:<b> Direct observation, questionnaires, interviews</b>
                        </p>

                        <h2>Direct observation</h2>
                        <p>study<b> existing users</b>; study users <b>unprompted</b>; asks users to carry out certain
                            tasks in a lab;
                            <br>
                            issues: hard to monitor people who use the product in privacy (mobile phones); <br>
                            <b>artefact -</b> object or aid used in the performance of a task - <b>sticky notes</b> for
                            reminders,
                            manual
                            references.</p>

                        <h2>questionnaires</h2>

                        <p>ask about their experience; how much exp they have; what did they use the system for; did
                            they try out competition; <br>
                            make sure to design the questionnaire from users point of view not developers <br>
                            be aware of problems; check normative bias ; get the questionnaire reviewed;
                        </p>
                        <h2>Interviews - walk through</h2>
                        <p>pen and paper; subject describes his experience as its usually; helps identify incomplete
                            steps; <br>
                            <b> advantage:</b> flexible questions tailored to users answers; <br>
                            <b> disadvantages:</b> interviewee can feel obliged to say nice things, can be biased
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>how will the application be used?
                        <p>weather conditions; time constraints; screen size; primary/secondary task?; surroundings;
                            <br>
                            apps for general purpose computers pose fewer problems as users<b> have more control</b>;
                            <br>
                            consider: <b>physical aspects</b> ( lighting, noise); <b>safety aspects</b> (distractions
                            while driving) ; <br>
                            <b>social aspects </b>( individual / group working ) ; <b>organisational Aspect</b>
                            (policies, user
                            support);
                        </p>

            <h1>conceptual Design/ re-engineering/ Mental Models</h1>

            <section>
                <a href="../downloadPDFS/user-design2.pdf" target="_blank">Lecture notes- user design 2</a>

                <h2>Conceptual Design</h2>
                <p>
                    - What is presented on the screen (or other methods at each stage ) of the interaction <br> <br>
                    incorporates relevant Guidelines and may be based on formal modelling <br><br>
                    designer should ask himself : re-engineer the task? should a metaphor be used?
                </p>

                <h2>Re-engineering</h2>
                <p>First designers try to visualise how the user might go about performing a task, then they try to
                    accommodate that in an easy way
                    , called<b> conceptualisation of a task</b>. Re-engineering often leads to the creation of a
                    <b>metaphor</b>
                </p>

                <h2>Metaphor</h2>
                <p>
                    - word/phrase to suggest a <b>likeness or analogy </b>between two objects/ <b>actions</b> <br>
                    a lot of things in a modern computer are metaphors - folders ( borrowed from real life folders) ,
                    deleting into a bin ( throwing paper/files into a trash can)
                </p>
                <p>Simple way of helping users to develop a suitable <b> mental model of a system</b> <br>
                    a Metaphor carries specific set of ideas and users will assume it will do what it represents, they
                    must be chosen carefully <br>
                    examples: calculator app looks like real calculator - ecommerce have baskets just like stores ;
                </p>
                <h2>Mental Models</h2>
                <p>- we constantly build, develop and update our <b>model of the world</b> and things/systems inside it.
                    <br><br>
                    We approach new situations by <b>comparing them</b> to something we know, if we are trying to use
                    something
                    we have never encountered before even anything similar it could be very <b>hard to develop a new
                        model,</b>
                    rather than modify an existing model
                </p>
                <h2>Structural Model - how it works</h2>
                <p>
                    structure of some system or device, like a <b>mental map of a city</b>. e.g london taxi drivers <br>
                    <b> Takes years to develop</b> a solid structural model, and it represents the inner working of it
                </p>

                <h2>Functional Model - how to use it</h2>

                <p>Represents the <b>procedures/steps </b>you take to <b>perform tasks</b> on a device that you need.
                    <br>
                    'procedural knowledge about how to use a system or a device' . <br>
                    like using the ATM, you have the <b>Functional knowledge on how to do what you want</b>, but not a
                    Structural knowledge to know how its actually done on the inside (internal structure)
                </p>

                <ol class="guidelines">
                    <li>Strive for consistency
                        <p>
                            if you have 2 similar tasks try to have 2 <b>similar sequences of actions</b> to do them.
                            <br>
                            Menus on your website should have <b>same terminology</b> throughout <br>
                            set up the<b> "look and feel" </b><br>
                            <b>exceptions</b> should be minimised and comprehensible.

                            <br><br>
                            <div>
                                a drop down menu should always keep the same layout despite change of mode. with grayed

                                illegal actions,
                                users learn faster if its consistent. Employ the same color scheme and html structure
                                with
                                tags meaning the same type of content throughout

                        <p>Cater for diverse users (age,expertise,special needs) <br><br>
                            when doing a feature make sure its available to novices (with explanations) but also provide
                            shortcuts for experts <br><br>

                            <div>
                                Make sure your content is designed for plasticity (can be transformed) - text is safest.
                                Website html reflects the visual structure so it can be read properly by Text-To-Speech.
                                Use
                                main,aside,footer to convey structure programmatically

                    <li>Offer informative feedback

                        <p>when user completes an action (big or small) an equally good feedback should be given <br>
                            visual representation of objects of interest showing the results of actions <br>
                            "when dragging an item have a toast that says copied/moved successfully" <br> <br>

                                when saving a file make sure the user sees the file saved - unsaved file has a dot with

                                they are in. It helps the user to complete the questionnaire if they have answered 30/40
                                questions and they know it rather than if they are unaware and feel like questionnaire

                            User feels anxious if they perform an error and learn slower. <br><br>

                    Four general principals: <br><br>
                    <b> Perceivable -</b> users must be able to perceive info.Cater for all senses if possible<br>
                    <b> Operable -</b> cannot have interactions that a user cannot perform <br>
                    <b> Understandable -</b> users have to understand the interface, cannot be beyond their
                    understanding <br>
                    <b> Robust -</b> Access content as technologies advance - Accessible content for older technologies
                </p>
                <h2>Priorities</h2>
                <p><b>Priority 1 </b>- if not satisfied the page will be <b>impossible</b> for some users to access <br>
                    <b>priority 2</b> - page will be<b> difficult</b> for some users to access <br>
                    <b> priority 3 </b>- <b>somewhat difficult</b> to access for some users
                </p>
                <p>AAA - all 3 priorities satisfied ,AA - 1 and 2 satisfied, A - 1 satisfied</p>
                <h2>The Guidelines</h2>
                <ul class="guidelines">
                    <span>Perceivable</span>
                    <li>1.1 - Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other
                        forms people need
                        <p>
                            name/alt tags, video transcriptions, music transcriptions. Remember to preserve order
                            of information so it can be determined programmatically

                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>1.2 Provide alternatives for time-based media

                    </li>
                    <li>1.3 Create content that can be presented in different ways without losing information or
                        structure.
                        <p>programmatically determine the sequence (if necessary). Text is almost universal, make sure
                            everything is transcribed, don't rely on shape size or location for conveying info
                            <br><br>
                            <div>
                                use proper html tags like main. aside, footer to determine the layout rather than
                                styling (which is just visual) <br>
                                Shape and size of heading and information should also be possible to determine
                                programmatically, so like h1, h2 and main is the main focus of the page.

                <p>
                    many different styles are often mixed to best suit the task at hand or because of the circumstances
                    or support of hardware.

                </p>
                <p>in recent years , with html5, the web supports a lot more interaction than before, it is almost as
                    introcate as computer applications
                    due to JavaScript and other client/server side languages, more interaction is possible.

                <p>Evaluators asses the system/interface in the <b>light of the heuristic</b> ( not to their own taste)
                    - they
                    work through the<b> interface</b> several times and write down <b>comments</b> on their findings, if
                    they
                    encounter a problem they should write it down and comment it before asking for help</p>

                <p>They should <b>work alone</b> so they cannot be<b> influenced by anyone</b> else; only after they
                    commented
                    everything should they be allowed to communicate. Use more than 2 Evaluators ( different people spot
                    different problems )</p>

                <h2>Usability Metrics</h2>
                <p>
                    a range of techniques that are more expensive and time consuming than Heuristics <br>
                    basically asking a bunch of users to perform specified tasks - <b>data gathered</b> from that
                    <b>Qualitative or quantitative</b> data
                </p>

                <h2>quantitative Metrics</h2>
                <p> usually deal with numerical data %s, seconds, count : <br>
                    Success rate, time required, errors encountered, use of help, failed commands, user
                    satisfaction(subjective)</p>

                <p>This data is then used to give a usability score for the system <br>
                    one reliable method is<b> SUMI</b> - software usability measurement inventory - users use a system
                    and complete a
                    questionnaire about it <br>
                    general questions about the system ( would you use it daily, was it slow...) - at least 12 or more
                    people are required, more is better <br><br>
                    they are categorised as - <b>efficiency, affect , helpfulness , control, learnability</b>
                </p>
                <p>if scores from questionnaire vary - you can assume it <b>assesses the subjects</b> <br>
                    if scores are mostly even - you can assume it <b>assesses the system</b></p>

                <h2>Automated Testing</h2>
                <p>HTML (web pages) ar<b>e open-source </b>- they can be tested <b>automatically</b>. <br>
                    theres many automatic checkers , some check just the syntax some <b>check against guidelines</b></p>

                    <b> cognitive models </b>- incorporate users abilities, understanding and knowledge so it can be
                    used to design a computer system
                </p>

                <p>
                    Categories of<b> Cognitive models</b>: <br>
                    Hierarchical representations of the user's <b>task and goal</b> structure <br>

                </p>

                <p>Major issue with models : how to select the appropriate level of granularity : <br>
                    top level goals: many different levels can be defined, choice is made based on the system <br>
                    lowest-level sub-goal: should we break down goals until we reach individual finger movements? or is
                    that too much ?

                <h2>Fitt's law </h2>
                <p> - the time to move a pointer onto a target varies as a function of: the distance the

                <p>
                    - interaction at the level of <b>motor actions</b> <br>
                    unlike cognition, human motor system is <b>well understood</b> and easy to model. <br>
                    low level models like this produce <b>detailed and long descriptions</b> <br>

                <p>
                    Implications of <b>Fitt's law</b> : <br>
                    interaction times can be reduced by making the<b> targets bigger and distance shorter</b> <br>
                    pop up menus are faster ; pie chart menus (all points equidistant); <br>
                    efficiency of fixed linear menus can be increased by moving <b>frequently accessed</b> things at the
                    top
                    <br>
                    placing it at the edge so you can just yeet your mouse towards the edge and always get it <br>
                    <br>
                    even slightly increasing the target size <b> improves time</b> significantly <br>
                    <b>dragging takes longer than point and click</b> <br>

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    after following all the guidelines and rules on making software usable, the only way to truly test
                    it is to actually give it to <b>potential users </b>and monitor<b> their experience </b><br>
                    testing can be done at various stages in dev. <br>
                    this is called <b>iterative testing</b>
                </p>


                <h2>Designing controlled studies</h2>
                <p>
                    example of<b> controlled study</b>: comparing one system's effectiveness with another <br>
                    you need: <br> <br>
                    2 or more <b>conditions</b> to compare <br>
                    a set of <b>tasks</b> <br>
                    a prediction that can be tested <br>
                    set of <b>variables</b> ( independent and dependent) <br>
                    subjects divided into<b> groups</b> <br>
                    <b> experimental procedures</b>
                </p>

                <h2>Conditions</h2>
                <p>
                    comparing against a well known system, an<b> earlier version</b>, a <b>set standard </b><br>
                    make sure to compare under the <b>same conditions</b> and perform the same tasks

                </p>

                <p><b>Experimental condition</b> - condition where the new system is used <br>
                    <b>control condition</b> - reference system is used as a condition</p>


                <h2>Task</h2>
                <p>
                    task must be <b>relevant</b> to the system being<b> compared</b> <br>
                    testable against criteria and not be <b>unfair</b> ( where once system gives unfair advantage ) for
                    subjects <br>
                    sometimes theres <b>exceptions </b>to the rule: if we have a new feature we <b>need to test</b>, and
                    we know it
                    will give clear advantage over the old system, we might still take that into account
                </p>


                <h2>Predictions</h2>
                <p>
                    it must be framed so that it is testable
                </p>

                <h2>Variables</h2>
                <p>
                    <b> independent variable </b>- deliberately manipulate in some way , might be the control/experiment
                    system
                    itself <br>
                    <b>dependant variable</b> - variables we measure to see how<b> changes in the system are
                        affected</b>, like time
                    completion or satisfaction level... <br>
                    <br>
                    ideally we want <b>1 independent variable</b> all other factors should be stable , this allows us to
                    pin
                    point that the <b>changes in dependant variables</b> are <b>because of the</b> independent variable
                </p>



                <h2>Subjects and groups</h2>
                <p>subject should be potential users, someone that the system is aimed for and other casual users too
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b> independent measures - </b>divide subject randomly into groups and test each group under
                        different
                        conditions
                        <p>
                            the <b>least amount</b> of effort in testing - however its hard to tell what exactly caused
                            <b> differences in results</b> ( conditions or system changes)
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b> Matched subjects -</b> study the subjects and <b>categorise</b> them accordingly into
                        similar groups based
                        on some <b>criteria</b>
                        <p><b>More effort</b> as you need to study the subjects , but you then know that <b>differences
                                in result</b>
                            are because of differences in user category, this is a more sensitive design</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Repeated measures -</b> all subjects are tested under all conditions
                        <p> Very sensitive design - all subjects perform under ALL conditions, any changes observed must
                            be due to conditions. <br>
                            <b> issue:</b> subjects learn how to perform the task over time <br>
                            <b>solution</b>: split subjects in half - one half does the task in one order and the other
                            half in
                            reverse order
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Experimental Procedure</h2>
                <p>
                    specify the<b> procedure for the study</b>: what the subjects know, how much help they are
                    receiving, how
                    much time is allowed -<b> other details</b>
                </p>

                <h2>Quality of Data</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Carefully design</b> the questionnaire to give you back the data you actually need. <br>
                    simple questionnaire is good enough to gather data to fix your system <br>
                    however to prove that you system is<b> better than an existing one</b> , you need <b>statistical
                        tests</b>
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Nominal scaled data</b> - no numerical relationship between scores</li>
                    <li><b>ordinal scaled data </b>- 2 is higher than 1 but not necessarily twice as high</li>
                    <li><b>interval scaled data</b> - 2 is twice as high as 1, timing data </li>
                    <li><b>Parametric data -</b> must be interval scaled - data drawn from a population of<b> normal
                            distribution and normal variance</b></li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Normal Distribution</h2>
                <p>
                    intelligence, height life span of electronics and mechanics and many more follow a <b>normal
                        distribution</b> <br>
                    <b> symmetrical -</b> most of the scores fall in the <b>central region</b>( mean mode, median have
                    the same value ) <br>
                    can be defined using <b>variance</b> and <b>mean</b> value OR <b>standard deviation</b>
                </p>


                <h2>Variance</h2>
                <p>
                    measures how far a set of random number <b>spread out</b> from the<b> average value </b><br>
                    two sets may be normally distributed but have <b>different variance</b> (spread) <br>
                    this is also known as<b> standard deviation</b> <br>
                    standard deviation = <b>square root of variance </b>
                </p>


                <h2>Sensitivity</h2>
                <p>
                    the higher the quality of data<b> the fewer the sample</b> we need to have<b> accurate
                        conclusions</b> <br>
                    e.g - carrying out <b>parametric data</b> from <b>related sample</b> - we only need a<b> few
                        subjects</b> and we have valid data <br>
                    <b>nominal data</b> from <b>independent samples</b> - we need<b> far more subjects</b> to have valid
                    results
                </p>
