            <h1>Introduction to Java</h1>
            <p>
                Java is a compiled language. It's compiled, with javac into machine code, which is ran on JVM - Java
                Virtual Machine
            </p>

            <h3>Classes, states and behaviour</h3>
            <p>An object is a data type that is an instance of a class. A class is not an object, it creates them at
                runtime - its a blueprint. It knows </p>
            <ul>
                <li> what it does ( knwoing: variables in memory )</li>
                <li> and it what its meant to do ( its methods ) </li>
            </ul>
            <h3> Public vs Private</h3>
            <p>public means it can be accesses by outsiders, private can only be accessed within the implementation.
                it isn't a good idea to have publiv attributes. Getters and Setters should be provided where necessary.
            </p>
            <h3>Static - Class attribute, without that its an instance attribute</h3>

            <h3>Class Constructors</h3>
            <p>Used to create an instance of the class. It has no return type, not even <b>void</b>. Many consturctors
                can be provided, with different number and/or different input types.
                When constructing the one that fits the parameters given is used</p>
