        <h1>Database Specification</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>Create/ update / insert table</h2>
            <pre><code>
CREATE TABLE students (
    id_number CHAR(9) ,
    first_name VARCHAR(20),
    ...
);


DELETE
 FROM students
WHERE id number = ’987654321’;

UPDATE students
 SET points = 500
 WHERE id number = ’112356489’;

 INSERT INTO students VALUES ("123456789", "John");
            </code></pre>

            <p>
                the effect of the CREATE TABLE command is to store a descriptor of the table in the
                database directory [system catalog]; the effect of ALTER TABLE is to modify that descriptor;
                the effect of DROP TABLE is to remove the descriptor
            </p>


            <h2>CREATE INDEX - WORKS_ON</h2>
            <pre><code>
        CREATE INDEX EMPIX ON EMPLOYEE(SSN);
        CREATE INDEX WEP ON WORKS_ON(ESSN, PNO);
        CREATE UNIQUE INDEX DEPTX ON DEPARTMENT(DNUMBER);
        DROP INDEX EMPIX;
            </code></pre>
            <p>Index is a secondary storage item that speeds up queries on the indexed columns. however it slows downs
                for updates/inserts and deletes. The query optimizer chooses to use the index or not when generating an
                evaluation plan. INDEXES are not visible to us and are just used to speed up queries.</p>


            <img src="../images/databases/datatypes.JPG" alt="">
            <ul>
                <li> INT (3) - displays in column width 3</li>
                <li> DECIMAL (7,2) - displays in “7.2” format</li>
                <li> CHAR (15) - storage 15 characters, padded</li>
                <li> VARCHAR (15) - max storage 15 characters, unpadded</li>
                <li>TEXT/BLOB types are relatively uncommon, as they don’t fit easily into a table
                    structure</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>SQL CONSTRAINTS</h2>

            <p>
                <b> Constraints</b> are used to limit the type of data that can go into a table. This ensures the
                accuracy and
                <b> reliability</b> of the data in the table. If there is any<b> violation between the constraint</b>
                and the data
                action, the action is aborted. They can be present across the table or just one columns.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <span>Common Constraints</span>
                <li><b>NOT NULL</b></li>
                <li> <b>UNIQUE -</b> all values in that column are unique</li>
                <li> <b>PRIMARY KEY - </b>combines NOT NULL AND UNIQUE to identify each row</li>
                <li> <b>FOREIGN KEY -</b> a primary key of another table for reference</li>
                <li><b>CHECK - </b>all values in a column satisfy a specific condition</li>
                <li><b>DEFAULT -</b> gives a column a default value if left empty</li>
                <li><b>INDEX -</b> used to create and retreive data from db really quickly.</li>

            </ul>


            <h2>Referential integrity violation</h2>
            <p>DML (data Manipulation language) statements like update, insert or delete can cause the table and db to
                be inconsistent. for example creating a row for an employee with Dno = 50, but there isn't a Department
                50 so it cannot be possible to query that employee successfully.</p>

            <ul>
                <span>How to solve this:</span>
                <li>Choose the people you give permissions to wisely, and trust them and do nothing hoping it will be
                    fine. Easy to do;<b> Disadvantage:</b> DB corruption is almost certain</li>
                <li>Specify Constraints for columns and tables to ensure data is put in properly. <b>Advantage:</b>
                    automated
                    consistency checks, <b>Disadvantage:</b> slower SQL evaluation, and problems with making the queries
                    could
                    arise.</li>

                <li>Use a middle man - PhP to interact with the database, it can do more sanity checks and queries are
                    more consistent.
                    <b> advantage:</b> sophisticated validation of data and commands<b> Disadvantage:</b> Requires time
                    and effort to
                    build.
                </li>

            </ul>

            <h2>DCL - Data Control language</h2>
            <p>GRANT and REVOKE give and take permissions for tables/databases for a specific(named) user. <br><br>
                GRANT/REVOKE - ALTER[table], INDEX[create and drop], SELECT, INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE, ALL <br>

                tables)
            </p>
            <h2>Creating a new user</h2>

                CONNECT : login to DBMS only <br>

            <h2>Limitations Of SQL (privacy)</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Security Cannot be for individual columns. You cannot hide a column if granting permissions
                    to a
                    user.
                </li>
                <li>Sometimes simple data retrieval requires complex SQL query due to design of the SQL table
                </li>

            </ol>
            <h2>What are VIEWS?</h2>
            <p>
                VIEW - a derived table from a base table ( or more ), Data is not stored on disk but dynamically
                produced
                when asked. <br><br>
                VIEWS solve the 2 limitations above, by simplifying SQL query statements as a view can combine
                one or
                more
                tables. A VIEW is also treated as a normal db table. Meaning you can give permissions on a VIEW
                to a
                user.
                This allows you to cut out sensitive columns (solving first limitation). <br><br>

                The Database system stores the Query of the VIEW - not the table, meaning any updates to the
                base
                table/s
                are reflected in the VIEW.
            </p>

            <h2>Creating VIEWS</h2>
            <p>Create a view containing information on Houston-based employees of Department 5. <br><br>
                creating a view is a simple as sticking "CREATE VIEW x AS" and follow it with a SELECT
                statement.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
        CREATE VIEW HoustonEmployeesD5 AS
        SELECT Ssn, Fname, Lname, Sex, Salary
        FROM EMPLOYEE
        WHERE Address LIKE ‘%Houston, TX’
            AND Dno = 5;
        
        
        CREATE VIEW HER_1 ( StaffId, Name, Sex, Salary ) AS
        SELECT Ssn, CONCAT (Lname, ‘, ‘, Fname), Sex, Salary
        FROM EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT
        WHERE Dno = DNumber
            AND Address LIKE ‘%Houston, TX’
            AND Dname = ‘Research’
              </code></pre>

            <h2>Using the VIEWS - implementation</h2>

            <p>
                Treated exactly the same way as normal base tables. <br><br>
                howevery after submitting your query it undergoes -<b> query modification</b> .
                The text of the view and text of the user query are merged into a single final query that refers
                only to
                base tables.
            </p>

            <pre><code>
        View Definition:
        
        CREATE VIEW MaleStaff AS
        SELECT Ssn, Fname, Lname, Bdate, Salary
        FROM EMPLOYEE
        WHERE Sex = 'M';
        
        User Query
        
        SELECT Fname, Lname
        FROM MaleStaff
        WHERE Salary > 50000;
        
        Final Query
        
        SELECT Fname, Lname
        
        FROM EMPLOYEE
        WHERE Sex = 'M'
        
            and Salary > 50000
                </code></pre>

            <h2>View Updatability</h2>
            <p>
                Problems arise when trying to use INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE on a view because a view may be many
                tables
                acting as one, it can be a single table but with only some columns. <br><br>
                beacuse a view is not actual physical data and is derived dynamically, it cannot be updated.
                However
                some DBMS allows for (it updates the base table through the view) this,but with certain rules.
                rules are - single table view, a view has all of the NOT NULL columns, and not function calls
                inside the
                view creation statement.

        <h1>File support</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>DBMS Storage engine</h2>
            <p>
                DBMS do not use in-built File system. They just request data and they have their own native file
                system
                powered by Storage engine.

                <br><br>
                storage engine is tuned to cater for specific data retrievals (SELECT). It handles concurrent
                access to
                file/table data and data conflicts, indexing.
                The DBMS file system is specific.
            </p>

            <h2>How a hard-drive works</h2>
            <p>HDD is divited into tracks and sectors ( and Cylinders nad clusters), they are used as storage
                bins (of
                fixed 512bytes capacity).
                <br><br>
                To read data from a sector there is a seek delay ( 4-9 ms) and a rotational delay ( 2ms). Its
                best if a
                file is stored on a single or adjacent, cylinders of disk.
            </p>

            <h2>File System - File Manager - Storage Manager</h2>
            <p>File directory - partly visible and partly hidden for file/disk Administration. <br>
                file organisations - serial, sequential and indexed sequential
            </p>

            <h2>File allocation</h2>
            <p>records are packed into a <b>sector</b> ( e.g 4 110Byte records can fit into a sector with
                80bytes left
                over.)
                <br>
                this is limiting as only<b> serial files</b> are possible and reorganizing files on disk is very
                difficult.
                <br><br>
                <b>sequential files -</b> supported by keeping sectors 66% full (partially filled) and split the
                sector
                when
                insertions cause it to overflow. <br>
                <b>Indexed sequential files </b>- supported by keeping the lowest key value of an data sector in
                master
                sectors
                along the data sector pointer. They are called index sectors and form a data structure ( B+
                tree) that
                supports <b>sparse index,</b> as only one index per sector is made and not one index per record.

            </p>

            <p>
                On average - validation take sup 80% of the time, and execution itself takes 20%

            </p>

            <h2>Sequential File Organisation</h2>
            <p>
                Records are stored and accessed in a particular order using a <b>key under which they are sorted
                    on</b>.
                <br>
                for Retreival - you need to search sequentially through the entire file <b>record by record</b>.
                <br><br>

                primarily used in apps where there is a high file hit rate. Makes them good for master files and
                batch
                processing (like payroll systems) <br><br>

                Sometimes when overflow happens, the records are not contiguous anymore but are mapped in such a
                way
                that they are still retreived win their sequential sorted order despite different physical
                location
            </p>

            <h2>Serial File Organisation</h2>

            <p>
                Records entered in order of <b>their creation , unordered.</b> Serial files are primarily used
                as
                transaction
                files in which the transactions are recorded <b>in the order that they occur</b> <br><br>

                its only used on a serial medium like Magnetic tape. Usually used for transaction files
                (unsorted) and
                dump files.
                to find anything you need to look through all the records.
            </p>
            <h2>Indexed - sequential File Organisation</h2>
            <p> They are the same as sequential files but have an index for a block that contains the record
                given a key
                value. <br><br>
                Stored and sorted with a primary key, for each primary key an index is generated and mapped to
                the
                record. <br><br>
                record can <b>accessed either sequentially </b>(in the order they were entered) or<b> randomly
                    (with an
                    index)</b>
            </p>
            <h2>Sample exam Questions and Answers</h2>

            <p>What function does a <b>storage engine</b> play in a modern database management system? Why is it
            </p>

            <div class="answer">
                <p>
                    Storage engine is used (tuned) to cater for the specific file access patterns and storage of
                    DBMS.
                    it is specifically tuned for r<b>etrieval for SELECT statements</b>, it also handles
                    multiple access
                    to
                    files/tables <b>(concurrent access)</b>. It also handles <b>data conflicts</b>.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                In what way does the presence of <b>variable-length </b>records within a file impact on the
                subsequent
                <b> processing</b> of that file?
            </p>

            <div class="answer">
                <p>
                    DBMS treats the variable length field <b>as a fixed size</b>. This aids access of columns as
                    records
                    can
                    now be accessed at known offsets. ( for example if its known that each record is 100bytes
                    long
                    rather than around 100 bytes) <br><br>
                    The file system can have<b> predefined index</b> to jump to every time to read a new record
                    (and
                    knows
                    where ite ends). <br>
                    if the variable length file was stored in a variable fashion, the File System would have to
                    read it
                    one by one until it reaches a <b>terminator character</b> signifying the end of the record.
                    By having it fixed it can skip this and read in the whole record cos it <b>knows where the
                        terminator</b>
                    is.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>Under what conditions would a serial file suffice for database table storage? What about a
                sequential
                file? What about an indexed sequential file?</p>

            <div class="answer">
                <p> Serial files are used mainly for storing <b>transactions</b> and they are unordered,
                    They need to be <b>read 1 by 1</b> to find any record. <br><br>
                    Sequential files are useful for <b>batch processing</b> systems like<b> Payroll</b> systems.
                    They
                    are ordered based on a
                    key. <br><br>
                    Indexed-Sequential file are essentially like sequential files but also maintain an index
                    value and
                    when given a key you can obtain an index to directly access the sector/block the record is
                    held in.
                    They would be useful for<b> identifying files with search systems</b> and accessing more
                    specific
                    data.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>What is multiple buffering and what role does it play in database query processing?</p>

            <div class="answer">
                <p>
                    Multiple processing referes to the idea of having <b>many buffers to hold block of data.</b>
                    For
                    query
                    processing, having multiple buffers allows DBMS to<b> process one record</b> while another
                    record it
                    being
                    <b> brought in. </b>This means that when DBMS is finished processing a record another record
                    is
                    already
                    waiting/ or close to being brought in. This <b>improves performance</b> as it reduces
                    potential
                    stalls as
                    we wait for info to be brought in from disk <br><br>

                    unrelated example: for displays one buffer holds the current frame being displayed while
                    another is
                    acquiring bits for the next frame. So when it is time to switch the next frame is ready.

        <h1>Some Questions and Answers</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>PHP can dynamically send HTML to user's browser, how? Give examples</h2>
            <p>
                dynamic html - html that is more interactive and can change based on some conditions. PHP can achieve
                this by generating a html page based on some conditions. This means that the website might not be
                identical across two computers as conditions change and the webpage is dynamic.
                <br><br>
                example- only showing a section of the page if a user is a registered member. can be achieved (checked
                and generated) by php. if ($member == true) { # content just for members here } else # content for
                normal visitors

            </p>

            <h2>A PHP program that runs correctly when first written might subsequently result in errors, why?</h2>
            <p>Changes to the database, deletion of rows or any modification can cause a query to fail. Losing </p>

        <h1>Things to remember! </h1>

        <h2>CASCADING</h2>
        <p>
            "ON DELETE CASCADE" - it means that when deleting a row that hold a primary key that is referenced as
            foreign key in another table
            those entries are also deleted. <br><br>

            for example Deleting department number 5 entry with CASCADE will also delete any employee entry with dep.no
            5 as otherwise<b> referential integrity</b> will be violated . <br><br>
            <b> Cascading referential integrity</b> constraints are foreign key constraints that tell SQL Server to
            perform
            certain actions when a <b>primary key field</b> in a primary key-foreign key relationship is updated or
            deleted
        </p>

        <p>
            The ALTER TABLE statement is used to add, delete, or modify columns in an existing table.
            <br><br>
            The ALTER TABLE statement is also used to add and drop various constraints on an existing table.


        </p>
        <h2>SQL language types</h2>
        <p>DDL - database Definition language ( CREATE DROP ALTER) <br>
            DML - database Manipulation language (SELECT DELETE UPDATE INSERT)
            DCL - Database control language ( GRANT REVOKE)
        </p>

        <h2>Limitations Of SQL (privacy)</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Security Cannot be for individual columns. You cannot hide a column if granting permissions to a user.
            </li>
            <li>Sometimes simple data retrieval requires complex SQL query due to design of the SQL table</li>

        </ol>
        <h2>What are VIEWS?</h2>
        <p>
            VIEW - a derived table from a base table ( or more ), Data is not stored on disk but dynamically produced
            when asked. <br><br>
            VIEWS solve the 2 limitations above, by simplifying SQL query statements as a view can combine one or more
            tables. A VIEW is also treated as a normal db table. Meaning you can give permissions on a VIEW to a user.
            This allows you to cut out sensitive columns (solving first limitation). <br><br>

            The Database system stores the Query of the VIEW - not the table, meaning any updates to the base table/s
            are reflected in the VIEW.
        </p>

        <h2>SQL stuff</h2>
        <p>MySQL does not support embedded function calls – the calculation of a function of a function, for example
            <br>
            HAVING COUNT (*) = MAX (COUNT (*)) <br><br>

            When using sub-queries you are only allowed to return a single column.
        </p>

        <p>A COrrelated Subquery or Synchronized Subquery - is a subquery that uses information (like table name) from
            the outer query. For example here it uses outer query Dno value inside the subquery to get a result. You
            must Alias the outer table to use it inside a subquery</p>

        <pre><code>
                    SELECT Fname, Lname 
                    FROM Employee E
                    WHERE "Research" IN ( SELECT Dname 
                                FROM Department 
                                WHERE Dnumber = E.Dno
                        )
